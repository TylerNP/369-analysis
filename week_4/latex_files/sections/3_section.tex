\subsection{10 Pixels Apart?}

The next two most contested pixels are exactly 10 pixels apart in the x axis. Due to their close proximity, I hypothesized these two pixels correlated with the same art piece. So, I viewed the pixels placed around them to determine their correlation. From figure 3, it is clear that both pixels correlated to the eyes of the skeleton.

\subsection{Why So Much Focus On The Eyes?}

Despite encompassing an area roughly 35 x 65 pixels, the eyes drew the most user placements. From this, I assumed that it may have been a conflict between two groups that wanted different eye colors for the skeleton. To verify this assumption, I looked into to the top colors used at the locations. If a conflict occurred, then the two top colors should be the same for both eyes and should be relatively much larger than the other colors. 
From figure 4.b, it can be seen that black and light blue were orders of magnitude greater than the next most common color and that it was likely the product of the conflict between two groups.

\subsection{Why Black And Blue?}
The original art piece is One Piece's Crossbones maintained by r/onepiece and the other group is from r/Undertale. The r/Undertale community attempted to convert every skeleton into Sans with blue eyes and they focused on Crossbones. The fierce defense and attempt to convert Crossbones drove user activity specifically at the eyes.
