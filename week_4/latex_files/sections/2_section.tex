\subsection{Why (0,0) Was The Most Painted Corner?}
The most frequently placed pixel is in the upper left (0,0). The location (0,0) was easy to reach in a 2000 x 2000 grid and a highly recognizable location since it was in a corner. Since the corners were easy to reach and recognizable, users valued these locations more. I tested this by checking the activity in the other corners. Since the canvas expanded twice, the other corners were only available after some expansions. As a result, the upper left corner is at the top since it was accessible since the begin.

\subsection{Why This Corner?}

Since corners are considered valuable spaces, what was created here? In the top left, users created the "Connection lost" sign from RuneScape which also appeared in the top left. This sign was created by r/2007scape community from this iconic message appeared which in the top left of RuneScape. Hence it was created in the same place on the r/place 2022 canvas. With the top left corner as the most available corner and r/2007scape determined to maintain this image for its historic value (a continuation of the same sign from r/place 2017), the conflict focused user activity onto (0, 0).
