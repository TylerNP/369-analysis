The difficulty of searching and buying new video games gets harder every year. Reviews are one way that users choose one game over the other as the options and prices of video games increase each year. I hypothesize users with a decent number of games (10-30 games) and invested (40-100 hrs) in the game would make the most helpful reviews. Since users with too many games or too few games have too little investment into the game or too little experience with other games respectively. Likewise, users with too many hours may review a game with more bias due to the sunk cost fallacy. I also hypothesized that humor plays a large impact on the up votes of a review.
