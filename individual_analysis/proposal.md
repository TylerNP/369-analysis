# Steam Reviews Proposal

### Questions

Who makes helpful reviews and what makes them so?

How much does brand loyalty affect reviews?

### Significance

I want to know which user reviews are actually meaningful, so that I can make better decisions on purchasing new games.

### Hypothesis

I think users with a decent number of games (10-30 games) and not too much hours invested (2000+ hrs) in the game would make the most helpful reviews. Since users with too many games or too few games have too little investment into the game or too little experience with other games respectively. Likewise, users with too many hours may review a game wtih more bias due to the sunk cost fallacy. Additionally, users that make reviews for few or only one game author may make biased reviews due to their loyalty to that author.
