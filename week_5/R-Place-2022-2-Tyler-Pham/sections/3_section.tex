\section{Comparison Duckdb Vs. PySpark}
{\color{gray}\hrule}

\subsection{Memory}
The parquet file containing the data in parquet form was 1.84 Gigs.Looking at the Duckdb version, loading the parquet file into memory took anywhere between 8-10 Gigs of memory, while the PySpark version only took about 2 Gigs of memory. 

\subsection{CPU}
The reverse is true in regards to CPU usage. Running the same queries in Duckdb resulted in almost negligible CPU usage compared to my idle. On the other hand, PySpark had a much higher CPU demand usage demanded upwards of 50 percent for a query.

\subsection{Time}
Similarly to the CPU section, Duckdb performed almost all queries sub 1 second, but PySpark took at minimum 1 second.
